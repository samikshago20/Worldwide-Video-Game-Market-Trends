## Situation
You recently started working as a data analyst for Mavendo Games, a video game firm that has produced many hits around the world.

## Assignment

In order to identify the most potential titles and marketplaces, Mavendo titles' senior leadership requires greater insight into the gaming sector.
The executive team has requested that you create an interactive dashboard that allows them to examine topics such as the most popular genres, games, systems, and more.
 ## Objectives:
 ### 1. Profile & QA the data

- Open the vgchartz-2024.csv file by importing it.
- Verify that any datetime columns have the correct datatype by checking the datatypes.
- Change the columns labelled "title," "console," "genre," "publisher," and "developer" to begin with capital letters.
- Building on the'release_date' column, create a'release_year' column.


### 2. Prepare the data for visualization
- Make a table called annual_sales that computes the total sales for each year.
- The ten best-selling titles by "total_sales" are then arranged in a table called top10_titles, from highest to lowest.

### 3. Build a dynamicÂ dashboard
- Make a line graph showing total sales by year.
- With total_sales on the y-axis, make a bar chart of the top ten best-selling books ever.
- Create a dashboard containing radio buttons for "total_sales," "jp_sales," "na_sales," "pal_sales," and "other_sales," as well as dropdown menus for "title," "genre," "publisher," "developer," and "console." Based on the two tables we built in assignment 2, this dashboard should feature a bar chart that displays the best sellers by category and a line chart that shows sales by year.
- The user should be able to plot the top 10 for each category in the bar chart using the dropdown menu. This will alter how your underlying data is aggregated. The sales numbers displayed in the line and bar charts ought should be impacted by the radio button.
